# Volume Set Example (index only)

This example shows a `sitepack.volumes.json` descriptor for a split package.
The actual volume files are not included in the repository and are expected to be produced by exporter tools.

Use this example to validate the volume-set schema and to illustrate the distribution metadata format.
