# LLM Materials Usage

This folder contains a short specification and task briefs for generating SitePack export/import/validation code. Recommended flow:
1) Read `LLM_SPEC_SHORT.md` for format context.
2) Choose a task: `TASKS_VALIDATOR.md`, `TASKS_EXPORTER.md`, or `TASKS_IMPORTER.md`.
3) Follow the input/output and report requirements.

These documents are intended to be passed directly to an LLM as technical briefs. For full details, refer to `SPEC.md` and the schemas in `schemas/`.
